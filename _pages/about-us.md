Brains interact with technology to turn imagination into reality.

NeuroGEARS is born from the desire to explore and express inspiring possibilities of technology; and to make those possibilities more accessible to everyone. We are a network of explorers who like to imagine, use, and teach technology, so that more people can turn their dreams into reality.

Gonçalo is a software engineer turned neuroscientist, fascinated by the behaviour of intelligent systems. With a background of applied research in virtual and augmented reality, parallel processing and autonomous agents, he joined the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in 2010, hoping to find better ways of building machines that learn by themselves. He completed his PhD with Adam Kampff and Joe Paton, trying to understand what is the role of motor cortex in the control of movement in non-primate mammals.

Along the way, Gonçalo extended his experience making interactive systems to rodents and other animal models. He developed the Bonsai visual programming language as a way to rapidly prototype interactive neuroscience experiments.
