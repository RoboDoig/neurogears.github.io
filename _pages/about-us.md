Brains interact with technology to turn imagination into reality.

NeuroGEARS is born from the desire to explore and create inspiring possibilities with technology; and to make those possibilities more accessible to everyone. We are a network of explorers who like to imagine, use, and teach technology, so that more people can turn their dreams into reality.

## Gonçalo Lopes

Gonçalo is a software engineer turned neuroscientist, fascinated by the behaviour of intelligent systems. With a background of applied research in virtual and augmented reality, parallel processing and autonomous agents, he joined the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in 2010, hoping to find better ways of building machines that learn by themselves. Gonçalo completed his PhD with Adam Kampff and Joe Paton, trying to understand what is the role of motor cortex in the control of movement in non-primate mammals.

Along the way, he extended his experience making interactive systems to rodents and other animal models. Gonçalo developed the Bonsai visual programming language as a way to rapidly prototype interactive neuroscience experiments.

João is a roboticist and software engineer with a long experience developing real-time interactive applications. Having worked for pioneer tech startups in robotics and augmented reality, he is used to mixing sensors, actuators, and embedded systems to create next generation human computer interfaces. His projects span many fields, including technologically enhanced dance performances, interactive museums, and autonomous search and rescue robots.

More recently, João joined the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme to help design high-end systems for electrophysiology. He also collaborated in the development of the Bonsai programming language.
